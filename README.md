​🧠 Logic Puzzle & Mathematical Utility Suite
​A comprehensive, console-based collection of interactive logic puzzles and numerical utilities written in C. This project is designed as a first-year academic project for building foundational algorithmic logic.

​✨ Project Overview

​This suite provides an interactive platform for users to test their mental math, logical reasoning, and pattern-recognition skills. Managed through an efficient command-line interface, it features multiple modules ranging from number theory checks to a playable 15-Puzzle.

​🎯 Key Features


​Magic Number Check: Identifies if the recursive sum of a number's digits equals 1.


​Palindrome Check: Verifies if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.


​Digit Frequency: Analyzes and counts the occurrence of each digit (0-9) in an input.


​Mathematical Quiz: Generates random arithmetic problems for real-time testing.


​Continuous Pattern: Displays geometric or numerical shapes using nested loop logic.


​15-Puzzle (Logic): A sliding tile game where users arrange numbers in a 4x4 grid.


​Sequence Solver: Predicts and solves the next numbers in a logical series.


​Decimal to Binary: A conversion utility for base-10 to base-2 transformations.



​🛠️ Technologies Used


​Language: C Programming Language


​Data Structures: 1D and 2D Arrays (for frequency and grid management)


​Control Structures: Nested Loops, Conditional Statements, and Modular Functions



​📚 Concepts Demonstrated


​Control Flow: Advanced implementation of for and while loops.


​Decision Making: Extensive use of if/else and switch-case statements.


​Grid Logic: Management of 2D arrays for interactive tile movement.


​Input Handling: Robust validation to prevent errors during user interactions.



​🚀 How to Run the Project
​Step 1: Open Terminal / Command Prompt
Locate your project files using your operating system's terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).

​Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder
Change your directory to the location where the project is saved.
cd path_to_puzzle_folder

​Step 3: 🛠️ Compile the Program
Use a C compiler (like GCC) to build the source code into an executable file named puzzle_suite.
gcc puzzle_suite.c -o puzzle_suite

​Step 4: 🏃 Run the Program
Execute the compiled file to launch the interactive menu-driven interface.

​📂 Files in the Project


​puzzle_suite.c: Main source code containing all puzzle and game logic.


​README.md: Project documentation, instructions, and features list.



​📝 Important Notes


​Grid Management: The 15-Puzzle module utilizes a 2D array to track tile movements and empty spaces.


​Real-time Results: All mathematical diagnostics and quiz scores are processed instantly within the console.
